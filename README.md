# Surgery Day Medications

This project was started to help patients and the people who care for them have some evidence based guidance about their medications in the period leading up to a scheduled surgery.  

If this project interests you and you have questions or want to help please reach out to me here through my github account.  

I'm using the [FDA's](http://www.fda.gov/default.htm) [National Drug Code Directory](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm142438.htm) Database file which can be downloaded [here](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm142438.htm).

I've generated a file epcs.cvs with all of the FDA's unique [Established Pharmacologic Classes (EPC's)](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/ucm162549.htm)

My first step is reviewing all of the FDA  and associating each one with a rule.  There are only 355 so that shouldn't take too long.
